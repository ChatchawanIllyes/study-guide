Edge Cases to Consider
1. Empty Input
Description: The input is empty (e.g., an empty array, string, or tree).

Examples:

Array: []

String: ""

Tree: null

Why It Matters: Many algorithms assume non-empty inputs, so this can cause crashes or incorrect results.

2. Single Element Input
Description: The input contains only one element.

Examples:

Array: [1]

String: "a"

Tree: A single node.

Why It Matters: Some algorithms fail when there’s only one element because they rely on comparisons or iterations.

3. All Identical Elements
Description: All elements in the input are the same.

Examples:

Array: [1, 1, 1, 1]

String: "aaaa"

Why It Matters: Algorithms that rely on differences between elements may fail or behave unexpectedly.

4. Large Input
Description: The input is very large (e.g., the maximum allowed size).

Examples:

Array: [1, 2, 3, ..., 10^5]

String: A string of length 10^5.

Why It Matters: Tests the efficiency of your solution and ensures it doesn’t exceed time or space limits.

5. Negative Numbers
Description: The input contains negative numbers.

Examples:

Array: [-1, -2, -3]

Why It Matters: Some algorithms assume non-negative numbers and may fail or produce incorrect results.

6. Zero Values
Description: The input contains zero values.

Examples:

Array: [0, 0, 0]

Integer: 0

Why It Matters: Zero can be a special case in many problems (e.g., division, multiplication, or counting).

7. Duplicates
Description: The input contains duplicate elements.

Examples:

Array: [1, 2, 2, 3]

String: "aabbb"

Why It Matters: Algorithms that assume unique elements may fail or produce incorrect results.

8. Sorted Input
Description: The input is already sorted (ascending or descending).

Examples:

Array: [1, 2, 3, 4] (ascending)

Array: [4, 3, 2, 1] (descending)

Why It Matters: Some algorithms behave differently on sorted inputs (e.g., binary search).

9. Reverse Sorted Input
Description: The input is sorted in reverse order.

Examples:

Array: [4, 3, 2, 1]

Why It Matters: Similar to sorted input, but tests if your algorithm handles descending order.

10. Null or Invalid Input
Description: The input is null, None, or invalid.

Examples:

Array: null

String: null

Why It Matters: Ensures your solution handles invalid inputs gracefully.

11. Overflow or Underflow
Description: The input causes integer overflow or underflow.

Examples:

Integer: 2^31 - 1 (maximum 32-bit integer)

Integer: -2^31 (minimum 32-bit integer)

Why It Matters: Ensures your solution handles large numbers correctly.

12. Cycles in Graphs or Linked Lists
Description: The input contains cycles (e.g., a circular linked list or a cyclic graph).

Examples:

Linked List: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 (cycle back to the first node)

Graph: A graph with a cycle.

Why It Matters: Ensures your solution detects and handles cycles correctly.

13. Disconnected Graphs
Description: The graph is disconnected (e.g., multiple components).

Examples:

Graph: Two separate subgraphs with no connections between them.

Why It Matters: Ensures your solution works for graphs that aren’t fully connected.

14. Balanced vs. Unbalanced Trees
Description: The tree is balanced or unbalanced.

Examples:

Balanced Tree: A binary tree where the height difference between left and right subtrees is at most 1.

Unbalanced Tree: A binary tree that degenerates into a linked list.

Why It Matters: Tests if your solution works for both balanced and unbalanced trees.

15. Multiple Solutions
Description: The problem has multiple valid solutions.

Examples:

Array: [1, 2, 3, 4] (multiple valid subsets or permutations)

Why It Matters: Ensures your solution can handle cases where there’s more than one correct answer.

16. Case Sensitivity (for Strings)
Description: The input string contains mixed cases (e.g., uppercase and lowercase letters).

Examples:

String: "Hello World"

Why It Matters: Ensures your solution handles case sensitivity correctly.

17. Whitespace (for Strings)
Description: The input string contains leading, trailing, or multiple spaces.

Examples:

String: " Hello World "

Why It Matters: Ensures your solution handles whitespace correctly.

18. Special Characters (for Strings)
Description: The input string contains special characters (e.g., !, @, #, $).

Examples:

String: "Hello@World!"

Why It Matters: Ensures your solution handles non-alphanumeric characters correctly.

19. Floating-Point Precision
Description: The input contains floating-point numbers.

Examples:

Array: [1.5, 2.3, 3.7]

Why It Matters: Ensures your solution handles floating-point precision correctly.

20. Multiple Data Types
Description: The input contains mixed data types (e.g., integers and strings).

Examples:

Array: [1, "a", 2, "b"]

Why It Matters: Ensures your solution handles mixed data types correctly.
