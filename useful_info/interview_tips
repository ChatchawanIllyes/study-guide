1. Dress well, it is better to overdress than underdress.
2. Don't be desperate, carry the energy that you are competent and qualified for the role. A desperate energy is a repellant energy.
3. Research the company and the person interviewing you. Find a way to tie in questions and comments that shows you've done your research.
4. Speak clearly and concisely. Try to avoid filler words like "um" and "like".
5. Prepare stories head of time (specifically for STAR method).
6. Ask questions at the end of your interview. My favorite questions are:
"You're going to interview alot of candidates and people that can do the job, but in your opinion what does the high performer look like?"
"What keeps you at this company? Was there a moment that made you realize that you were in a place you wanted to be long term?"
"Based on what we discussed today, is there a reason why you wouldn't be willing to move me forward in the interview process/extend an offer?"
