Questions to Ask During Technical Interviews
1. Clarify the Problem
"Can you clarify the problem statement?"

"What are the input and output formats?"

"Are there any constraints on the input size or values?"

2. Ask About Edge Cases
"Can the input be empty?"

"Can the input contain negative numbers?"

"Are there any special cases I should consider (e.g., duplicates, cycles)?"

3. Discuss Input Assumptions
"Can I assume the input is always valid?"

"Should I handle null or invalid inputs?"

"Is the input sorted or unsorted?"

4. Ask About Performance
"What is the expected time and space complexity?"

"Should I optimize for time or space?"

"Is the input size small enough for a brute-force solution?"

5. Confirm Output Requirements
"Should I return the output in a specific format?"

"Are there multiple valid outputs, or is there only one correct answer?"

"Should I handle ties or ambiguous cases?"

6. Discuss Test Cases
"Can you provide some sample inputs and expected outputs?"

"Should I write test cases for edge cases?"

"Are there any specific test cases I should consider?"
