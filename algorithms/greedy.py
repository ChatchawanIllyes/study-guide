# Greedy algorithms are a class of algorithms that make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a
# globally optimal solution. They are often used for optimization problems where a sequence of choices leads to the best
# solution.
#
# Key characteristics:
# - Make the best choice at each step without reconsidering previous choices.
# - Do not always guarantee the optimal solution but are efficient and often provide good approximations.
#
# Common problems solved using greedy algorithms:
# - Coin change problem
# - Fractional knapsack problem
# - Activity selection problem
# - Huffman coding
